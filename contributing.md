# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

- Even if you don't know Rust (which the interpreter is written in) you can contribute by writing tests in Uiua! See the existing tests [`here`](https://github.com/uiua-lang/uiua/tree/main/tests).
- If you find a bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/uiua-lang/uiua/issues/new) describing the bug and how to reproduce it.
- If you can fix a bug, please [fork the repository](https://github.com/uiua-lang/uiua/fork) and [create a pull request](https://github.com/uiua-lang/uiua/compare).
- For more complex changes, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/uiua-lang/uiua/issues/new) to discuss your idea first.
- For general discussion about the language including questions and ideas, see the [Discussions](https://github.com/uiua-lang/uiua/discussions) page.
